When I tried to integrate Strapi into my existing project that uses Liquid as the templating engine, I encountered some issues. While Liquid is is a good templating language, I found it less flexible and more challenging to work with compared to other templating engines like Nunjucks or plain JavaScript. For example: Liquid doesn’t support some complex logic as effectively, making it harder to handle.</p><p>  Because of these issues, I created a small example to understand strapi so I could implemented later in my project that I will be changing my templating language, I am thinking to use JS.</p><p></p><p>- Contentful Experiment: I have also create an account or sign up to be able to use it.</p><p>  I learned that same as strapi and I should say I tried Gost too but i wasn&#x27;t very lucky. Well, I have experience similar issues due to the same Templating Engines : liquid.</p><p>  Again I created a basic example as well, and I can tell I liked both and both are very good. Once everything gets stared everything seems very clear and easy to use. please see some of the screenshoots I took to show both examples.</p><p></p><p>- I decided Contentful should be the one to use once I finish the new using JS and stop using liquid</p><p></p><h4>- Strapi</h4><p></p><p>![test7](../../img/test7.jpg)</p><p></p><p>![test6](../../img/test6.jpg)</p><p></p><h4>Contentful</h4><p></p><p>![test8](../../img/test8.jpg)</p><p></p><p>![test9](../../img/test9.jpg)</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></section></div><ul class="pagination"><li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="/assignment/">1</a></li><li class="page-item"><a class="page-link" href="/assignment/1/">2</a></li><li class="page-item active"><span class="page-link" href="/assignment/2/">3<span class="visually-hidden">(current)</span></span></li></ul></main><footer> © 2024 Inguer Lara</footer></body></html>
